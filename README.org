A timer for the Pomodoro Technique [[http://www.pomodorotechnique.com]]

This pomodoro implementation is based on the ideas of Dave Kerschner's
pomodoro.el which you can get from [[https://github.com/docgnome/pomodoro.el][here]].

* Installation
  Simply place pomodoro.el in your Emacs load path and add

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'pomodoro)
  #+END_SRC

  to your .emacs

* Usage
  Use ~M-x pomodoro-start~ to start. This will cause a timer to appear
  in the mode line. When the timer runs down a break period will
  start. You stop your pomodoro cycles with ~M-x pomodoro-stop~.

  A read only buffer, by default called ~*pomodoros*~, will keep track
  of your progress (when a pomodoro start, finish, etc.)

* Customization
  Several customizations are available through ~M-x customize-group
  RET pomodoro RET~
